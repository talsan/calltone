       "73031   Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wanted to follow up on the guidance question a little bit more. So just think about it, the -- you'd be at about $0.27 year-to-date, you guided up 3Q about $0.08, and raise the year $0.10 to $0.15. So it seems like you're lowering the fourth quarter, I guess, implied versus a Street by $0.20 $0.25. Is that accurate? And I know you talked about the gaming h...  \n",
       "73053   No, I would definitely not characterize us as seeing anything that gives concern today. I mean, I think, we're very pleased with an almost 2% comp domestically here in Q2. We're seeing good buying behavior, and I think we continue to see consumer that's really interested in the products that we sell. And so that gives us confidence heading into the back half year.We definitely tighten the rang...  \n",
       "73054   And so that's a sort of a perfect segue into my follow-up here, right. You think about sort of your initial outlooks for certain product category growth in 2020, right, whether it's an acceleration in certain categories like gaming and mobile, maybe even TVs. I mean what categories give you sort of the greatest amount of pause, right, as you conceptualize the potential demand implications of r...  \n",

Maybe just a little more specificity, if you could on gaming, and why you think, I guess, the second half of the year, might be a little bit tougher than you initially thought, if I understood your comments correctly?  \n",
       "73058   Yes, Curt, the gaming cycle is well known, and as the year is progressed, what we've seen is there's more visibility to a couple of new platforms that have yet to be announced, but are well regarded as coming into play by next holiday season. The demand on the current console business is just off slightly more than we would have anticipated. And some of the things that are filling in this spac...  \n",
       "73064   No. The overall top line, I think, like we said, we see categories come up and down, like we always do. As we look at this point in the year, gaming is -- like we said is the biggest sequential drag as you look at the back half. I think the rest of the categories as you look into Q3 are kind of like what we expected them to be. Gaming be a little bit of a change. I think there is also what Cor...  \n",
       "81846   Thank you Dan, and good afternoon everyone. As you all know, I've missed our earnings conference call these last few quarters. So, let me begin by saying I feel good, I'm very happy to be here with Rob, Patrick and the team and I look forward to our discussion today. Let me also say that I am extremely touched by all the calls and emails I've received over the past several months. It has been ...  \n",
       "81848   Yeah, nice surprise. So, as you know, I mean Macao is the world's largest gaming market and the current, future growth of that market is predicated on the mass market. If you look at page 16 in the deck, you can see the continual year-after-year growth of this segment, and this is the segment that matters, let's be honest. And we are the market leader in those segments; mass to premium mass an...  \n",
       "81850   I think there is going to be disruption, but your reference point is spot on. I think, we can capture if the team does their job, capture some of that disruption or region in Four Seasons Indonesian [Phonetic] I'd like to think we can. Having said that, it's a massive project under way. I mean 2020 will be a disruptive year SCC, there is no denying it, we're transforming a 10-year-old product ...  \n",
       "81854   In Macao, as you know Thomas is the mass segment that drives growth, it's that simple. In this challenging macro environment, we just continue to see it, grow and grow and that business revolves around lodging, retail entertainment and we continue to see the numbers to grow in all these areas. The mass keeps growing, premium -- even with our large base our slots and premium kept growing and wi...  \n",
       "81878   Not a specific answer for September. But, I will tell you that we are focusing on getting more of this mass and premium mass business in our building again with 7000 plus accommodations, we should be getting more of it. We're looking -- we obviously keep focusing on the room product, the suite product, more attractions more F&B. I'm very pleased where our casino is going. We've seen nice bacca...  \n",
       "81891   Shaun, that thing's referenced page 19 ongoing strategic reinvestment. Page 19 gives you a great snapshot of our timing on this thing. You're right, we had a little delay in some of the issues in the Macao, but I think we're going to get to these timelines that we feel pretty confident. That Four Seasons, pretty much -- there is gaming happening as we speak today in the Four Seasons Macao. The...  \n",
       "103927  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we reported $9.76 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13, which was up 22% compared to the third quarter of last year. We delivered another strong quarter and are excited about our continued momentum and the opportunities we have ahe...  \n",
       "103928  Good morning, and hello everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.On enterprise revenue of $9.76 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better-than-expected top line results in the computing category...  \n",
       "103930  Sure. This is Matt. I'll take that question. First, in terms of the revenue guidance range, I think I would say, holiday is always a special season for consumer electronics. Pricing convenience is very important, and like any holiday we took a very disciplined approach to setting the range. And so what we've said we feel is very appropriate. I think in terms of what we're excited about that co...  \n",
       "103965  Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So one was a thought about, as we think about next year, it looks like you guys are putting a pretty strong comps even though there's really not a product cycle going on, at least that's my -- my thought. And as we get into next year, it seems like you have a number of drivers as we get 8K TVs coming down, in price, we get a 5G iPhone and we have two n...  \n",

And then on the gaming category weakness, curious if you could expand on that in a little more detail, whether you think it's primary -- primarily innovation driven or if there's something structural there. Just curious on your thoughts on when the category could turnaround?  \n",
       "103973  Hey, Zach, it's Mike. I think the gaming category still is exciting. We think about it more broadly than just the console category based on what we think and where consumers are looking for experiences to be enhanced. Obviously, we're on the year cycle of new devices coming out next holiday. So you've got kind of the best of both worlds for consumers thinking about what they want to do and the...  \n",
       "113482  Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter and a great year across all our markets. Companywide adjusted property EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.39 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Our cash flow generation is unmatched in our industry with full year 2019 EBITDA of $5.39 billion. Nobody has ever earned that before in...  \n",
       "113489  Yeah. So let's break it apart. A great base mass quarter ending up at almost 9%, 8.9%, or something like that. So base mass, we were -- I think our strongest base mass performance on our history, which we were delighted with and that remains a core part of our success. You're right, the premium mass business was not as strong, but still not a bad performance. I think what really is happening h...  \n",
       "113491  No, I just think you're seeing a shift to more non -- I mean, our business as you know is driven by, we have a gaming to follow up [Phonetic], but the non-gaming is powerful. If we can make $0.5 billion a year in Vegas every year, I'll be OK with that, the margins fall a few points. I think what you're seeing is, one thing you should realize with our business is that we are driven -- I mean th...  \n",

We have been there for what 18 years, 19 years and I think Sheldon's contribution, this Company's contribution as the biggest investor in Macao speaks for itself.

And our goal is to invest billions of dollars in M...  \n",
       "113527  Yeah. I mean, Sheldon has been very vocal about his willingness to invest heavily. We've spoken [Technical Issues] over the years about that. There is no surprise that we feel.

       "134281  Good morning. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter.

We had better than expected revenue results both online and within our international bus...  \n",
       "134283  Sure. This is Matt. I'll start with that. First, as arcs remarks, I believe we're operating in a very positive consumer environment similar to last year. All the data points indicate a good consumer and employment's good. Wage growth is good, consumer spending is good and wage forecast. That being said, separately, there is some supply chain-related issues as a result of the coronavirus. So on...  \n",
       "134327  We are growing our toy assortment rate, but it is not a meaningful business for us. And I don't think it will be. We look at toys as a nice color to our gaming business. And while traditional gaming has been down, computing gaming is up significantly. And we're always trying to find ways to meet our customers where they are from our shopping experience, and we'll continue to do that, but it's ...  \n",
       "134328  I think the wonderful thing is the vast majority of our assortment is now being at toys by kids. When you think about iPads, when you think about computing gaming, I mean toys for us is such a bigger answer because of the way kids are growing up today and what they value and want. So it's not just about the Toys open for us. It's about being positioned right at holiday to finish the list, like...  \n",
       "135673  Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for hosting this. So I have two questions. First, a bit of retrospective on the fourth quarter, how much do you think there were some industry factors that went on there, like in electronics and toys versus the six fewer days and versus what maybe you left on the table in non-gaming and electronics and home? And then related to that, as you get into the fourth ...  \n",
       "143435  Hey, Joe, it's Patrick. Thanks for the question. I think if you look back at our margin over the last couple of years as the premium mass and mass business grew, those margin areas are probably appropriate for recovery under normal run rate conditions. And so if you think about our expenses broken into categories, our largest expense is really gaming tax which is variable followed by our payro...  \n",
       "143445  So, kind of a two-part question there. I appreciate the detail. I think the way to think about margin recovery is that when you look at sort of call it our uncontrolled operating expenses, call it across '19 that represent a little bit more than 60% of our total expense structure. And so when you think about that and when you think about sort of our controlling operating expenses that was kind...  \n",
       "143448  Thank you, Patrick. We will reinstate the dividend after discussing with our Board of Directors. When things get back to where we were, it's very simple, I don't think it's a longtime away. If the rumors are Macao is a big percentage of our -- the both GGR, gross gaming income and our EBITDA. And I think that is a level we will come back first. Then probably Singapore and Vegas in that order p...  \n",
       "143467  Yeah. While currently as you know, the customer mix there is zero, since we're closed till June 1. The team is pretty confident that we'll get open in June. Doesn't very much concerned that it would be extended beyond this. They seem like they can. Have you saw the Journal this morning? The majority of the problem is in the -- has been isolated. And I think Paul and Andrew, and all the guys th...  \n",
       "143479  Hey. Thank you, and thanks everyone for the comments. I think this was probably best for you as you think about kind of the near to medium-term, and maybe make the assumption that specifically in Macao, I would imagine the two sub-segments of your gaming business will ramp at different speeds. Did you rather just strategically at all, just to maybe give business a little bit more toward a VIP ...  \n",
       "143496  Listen, we -- Macao is -- will be the best if not one of the best. It will be the best and the best gaming and leisure destination anywhere in the world. So there is no reason why it shouldn't grow. While Rob was talking, I was thinking about potentially it can only go as big as Vegas does. It actually the populations that it serves is much greater than what Vegas serves, and it could grow int...  \n",
       "143502  Hi. Evening, everyone and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just go back to the reopening and try and envision. And Rob, you touched on this on the mass side. What operationally it could look like from people taking the ferry, border crossings, etc.? Are we envisioning gloves masks and temperature and I suppose I would ask the same question about Las Vegas and given as you point out a...  \n",
       "149707  Sure, well, we're happy with the growth in Q1 on such a large base, again, we're -- now it's a $41 billion run rate and that's grown 33% year-over-year, but what we're seeing kind of post-COVID is it varies by industry. We think what is probably where we're a bit well-positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers, there's millions of active customers from start-ups, enterprises, the p...  \n",
       "171344  Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. Since our last earnings call, the world has continued to face unprecedented challenges with regard to health, economic and social issues.

       "172306  So there's a couple of things here. Some of it's related to permitting, but I think the key thing is we've completed the Grand Suites at Four Seasons. So that's done, right? The Londoner hotel, which is 580 suites, excluding some high-end suites, is done. And then between now and the end of the year, we're going to complete The Londoner court, which is 368 suites together with gaming and resta...  \n",
       "172318  So just one comment on the margin structure. If you think about the run rate business prior to COVID, more than 60% in Macao of our expenses were really variable, gaming taxes and sort of things related to the activity of the business. And so when you think about our controllable operating expenses, we have taken cost out of the business, but the margin structure you should expect is going to ...  \n",
       "172323  I think we've worked very well with our -- Thomas, to your point, our retail portfolio is a very important part of the mix of our business. We remain believers in that will come back in a big way in Asia, but MBS has started to ramp already. Obviously, Macao has not. We've worked very hard to foster strong relationships with the tenants in both jurisdictions, and we did rent reduction, etc.We'...  \n",
       "172326  There's still things on the books. We see Singapore as a starting point. We are seeing demand in Singapore, but I think people are very tentative about committing. There is inquiries.There's definitely bookings. But the caveat being that they can bow out within 90 days, there's plenty of room to quit if they don't see demand. So I think group is different. Corporate stuff is different than obv...  \n",

       "Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. So, your competitor thinks that just 10% of their sales were from crypto, or like $150, $160 million. You guys did almost $300 million there. Perhaps, I think, there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have two-thirds or more of that market? So, I guess, what&#x27;s going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that&#x27;s allowing you to have such share there or do you think it&#x27;s your competitors that don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market? Thanks. Well, we try to as transparently reveal our numbers as we can. Our strategy is to create a skew that allows the crypto miners to fulfill their needs and we call it CMP. As much as possible, fill their demand that way. Sometimes it&#x27;s just not possible because the demand is too great. But we try to do so. We try to keep the miners on the CMP skews as much as we can. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how other people do it, but that&#x27;s the warranty we do it. Thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations on all the financial records in the quarter. Jensen, I just wanted to come back to an announcement that you made at GTC with ray tracing. Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity and I think you noted at the time it was very computationally intensive. So the question is, as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we&#x27;ve seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high-end capability 1070 TI had launched last year; it was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">exciting</span> and very high-end technology to market? Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">invention</span> in the last 15 years. It took us a decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for one decade. To put it in perspective, it&#x27;s basically film rendering, cinematic rendering, except it&#x27;s in real time. It merges the style of computer graphics, restorization, and life simulation, what people call ray tracing, as well as deep learning and AI, and merged it into one, unified framework so that we can <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">achieve</span> cinematic rendering in real time. What is currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame.So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. In order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If it take several hours per frame and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real time, it basically takes a high performance computer or a super computer a render farm -- that&#x27;s why they call it a render farm -- it&#x27;s a full data center designed just for rendering.Now, we&#x27;ve created NVIDIA RTX, which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on four QUADRO GV100s. It takes four of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">able</span> to render 30 frames per second the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoy. The amount that we saved, we basically took an entire data center and reduced it into one node. We&#x27;re now doing it in real time. So, the amount of money that we can save people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content -- almost every single game is done that way -- there&#x27;s quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting.Then, of course, architecture design and car design. The number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. I&#x27;m certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them. So, that&#x27;s our starting point is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it, and hopefully more GPU servers will be purchased and, of course, <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">better</span> content will be created. Long-term, we&#x27;ve also now plotted the path toward doing it in real time. Someday, we will be <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">able</span> to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. We&#x27;re super <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excited</span> about RTX. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in for my follow-up. This is a question for Colette. I want to follow up again on the seasonality. I&#x27;m understanding the prior comments. Normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">decline</span> into Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around data center and the Volta ramps, I can&#x27;t bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the context of your guidance envelope. How should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter? Sure, Stacy. Let me see if I can <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">bridge</span> together Jensen and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn&#x27;t <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">able</span> to add on. But let me see if I can add on here and present a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember, in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of the new channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available. We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately. You can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency only boards.So, we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand. That then takes you now to Q2. But, if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don&#x27;t have to do those channel fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available. So, putting together Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality. Again, for a guidance, and we&#x27;ll see how we&#x27;ll finish in terms of the quarter, but you should be in that range. So, yes, from a normal seasonality at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2? Yes, we&#x27;re on that overall seasonality.Always keep in mind generally our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s. That&#x27;s what you should think about our overall guidance. Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last 3 to 5 years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We&#x27;ve just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately. I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are in terms of gaming seasonality. Great, thank you for taking my question and squeezing me in. The question relates to the supply chain <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">challenges</span> that you&#x27;ve talked so much about in the gaming end market. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s something particular to that end market that is making the <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">shortages</span> concentrated there or are, in fact, other end markets, in particular the data center end market also somewhat restricted from what growth they might have <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">achieved</span> if there weren&#x27;t the <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">shortages</span> that are out there, and maybe talk about the pace of recovery of those, that&#x27;d be really helpful. Thanks so much. Let me start off here and I&#x27;ll have Jensen finish up on the last part of that question. But overall, our data center business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well and even now with 32-bit, we&#x27;re seeing <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">tremendous</span> adoption throughout. Again, remember it&#x27;s very different than the overall consumer business. We have significant amount of time for qualification and that is moving extremely fast based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So, no, there is not a supply <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">challenge</span> at all in terms of the data center and our overall growth in data center we&#x27;re extremely <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with in terms of how the quarter came out. I&#x27;ll turn it over to you, Jensen, and you can answer the rest of the part of it? Yeah, the reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it&#x27;s not any sovereign currency. It&#x27;s in the digital world. It&#x27;s distributed. GeForce is the single, largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet. Every gamer has a super computer in their PC. GeForce is so broadly distributed, it&#x27;s available everywhere. And so, GeForce is really a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">good</span> candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along.We try the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">best</span> we can to go directly to the major miners. They represent the vast majority of the demand. To the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">best</span> of our ability, we serve their needs directly and we call that CMP and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not called GeForce, they&#x27;re called CMP. We can serve those miners directly, hopefully to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market because ultimately, what we would like is we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down so that the gamers could <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> from the GeForces that we built for them and the gaming demand is strong. The bottom line is Fortnite is a home run. The bottom line is PUBG is a home run. The number of gamers that are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">enjoying</span> these games is really astronomic, as people know very well.It&#x27;s a global phenomenon. These two games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe, as it is in the United States. Because you team up and this is a battle royale, you&#x27;d rather play with your friends, so it&#x27;s <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">incredibly</span> social. It&#x27;s <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">incredibly</span> sticky. More gamers that play, more of their friends join and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. So it&#x27;s this <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">positive</span> feedback system. The guys at Epic did a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">fantastic</span> job of creating Fortnite. It&#x27;s just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying.I think at the core of it, the gaming is <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> and we&#x27;re looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce card that is now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant and I&#x27;m expecting the gamers to be <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">able</span> to buy new GeForces pretty soon. Let&#x27;s see here. Is it my turn again? It is. Okay, we had another <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> quarter. Record revenue. Record margins. Record earnings. Growth across every platform. Data center <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">achieved</span> another record with <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> demand for Volta and AI inference. Gaming was strong. We&#x27;re <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">delighted</span> to see prices normalizing and we can <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">better</span> serve pent-up gamer demand. At the heart of our <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">opportunity</span> is the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">incredible</span> growth of computing demand of AI. Just as traditional computing has slowed, the GPU computing approach that we&#x27;ve pioneered is <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">ideal</span> for filling this vacuum. Our <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">invention</span> of the Tensor Core GPU has further <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">enhanced</span> our <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> position to power the AI era. I look forward to giving you another update next quarter. Thank you. Thanks, Brad. Before we begin, Deb has some opening comments.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures that we discuss today to GAAP measures are posted on our website, tjx.com, in the investor section. Thank you and now I&#x27;ll turn it back over to Ernie. Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. Let me begin by saying that I am very <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with our first quarter results. Both our consolidated comp stores sales growth of 3% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 exceeded our expectations. I am particularly <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with the 4% comp sales increase at Marmaxx and the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> performance across their Apparel and Home categories. I am also very <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> to day that we <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">successfully</span> addressed the third quarter execution issues that we had discussed last year and they are now behind us.In the first quarter, customer traffic was once again the primary driver of our comp sales increases at all four of our divisions. Further, this quarter marks the 15th consecutive quarter of customer traffic increases for TJX and Marmaxx. We believe that this consistency in our customer traffic increases speaks to the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strength</span> of our underlying business, our ability to <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">succeed</span> through many types of economic and retail environments, and our resiliency as online retail is growing. We are convinced that our outstanding values, <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> brands, and treasure-hunt shopping experience will allow us to continue <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gaining</span> market share around the world across our four major divisions.With our <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for our full-year earnings, which Scott will detail in a moment. Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> start and we see many <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">opportunities</span> to drive consumers to our retail banners. We see a marketplace that is loaded with quality branded merchandise. Our management team is laser focused on <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">achieving</span> our plans and, as always, we&#x27;ll strive to <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">surpass</span> them. We are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">confident</span> that we can continue to grow TJX around the globe today and for the future.Before I continue, I&#x27;ll turn the call over to Scott to recap our first quarter numbers. Scott? Thanks, Ernie, and <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">good</span> morning, everyone. As Ernie mentioned, our 3% consolidated comparable store sales increase exceeded our expectations. To be clear, our comp sales in Fiscal &#x27;19 are compared to a shifted Fiscal &#x27;18 calendar, so that our comps are calculated on a like-per-like basis. Once again, customer traffic was up overall and the primary driver of our comp sales increases at each of our four major divisions. As a reminder, our comp increase excludes the growth from our e-commerce businesses.First quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.13. Excluding a $0.17 <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> from the 2017 Tax Act, adjusted earnings per share were $0.96, a 17% increase over last year&#x27;s $0.82. Adjusted EPS was $0.09 above our plan, primarily due to better-than-expected operating results, which <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefited</span> EPS by an estimated $0.05. In addition, we had another $0.04 <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> from the combination of our mark-to-market <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gain</span> on our inventory hedges and share-based compensation coming in above plan.Overall, foreign currency <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefited</span> EPS growth by approximately 3% versus our plan of 1%. As expected, wage increases <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negatively</span> impacted EPS growth by about 2%. Consolidated pre-tax profit margin was 11%, up 30 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was due to several factors. These includes expense savings, <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">better</span> flow-through on the year-over-year sales improvement, a one-time lease buyout in Canada, and <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gains</span> related to inventory hedges. These benefits were partially offset by higher supply chain costs, a decrease in merchandise margin, and wage increases.At the end of the first quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including inventories held in warehouses, but excluding in-transit and e-commerce inventories, were up 6% on a constant currency basis versus a 7% decrease last year. We feel very comfortable with our inventory liquidity as we enter the second quarter. We are well positioned to capitalize on buying <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">opportunities</span> in a marketplace full of quality, fashionable, branded merchandise.Now, to recap our first quarter performance by division. Marmaxx comps increased a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> 4%, well above our plan. Comp sales were driven by customer traffic and both our Apparel and Home categories performed well. Again, we are very <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> to move past last year&#x27;s execution issues. Further, Marmaxx&#x27;s average ticket was slightly up and <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">better</span> than we planned. Segment profit margin increased 10 basis points, primarily due to <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">better</span> flow-through on the 4% comp. We are very <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with Marmaxx&#x27;s <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> start to the year, and are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excited</span> about the initiatives we have planned to drive traffic and sales.HomeGoods comps grew 2% over last year&#x27;s 3% increase. While sales were softer at the beginning of the quarter, business picked up in March and April to levels similar to the last couple of quarters. Further, overall sales in our first few HomeSense stores continued to exceed our expectations. Segment profit margin was down 200 basis points. This was primarily due to lower merchandise margin, largely as a result of increased <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">markdowns</span> earlier in the quarter, increased supply chain cost, and expenses related to new store openings. We feel <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> about the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">opportunity</span> we see to grow HomeGoods and HomeSense for the long term.TJX Canada&#x27;s first quarter comps grew 3% over a 3% last year. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency was up 170 basis points, primarily due to a one-time <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gain</span> related to a lease buyout which was contemplated in our plan. Canada&#x27;s significant wage pressure was mostly offset by an increase in merchandise margin, which was up significantly primarily due to <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">favorable</span> transactional foreign exchange. Without the lease buyout benefit, adjusted segment profit margin was still up. We continue to be <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with the overall performance with our Canadian business.At TJX International, comps increased 1% in the first quarter. In Europe, while we were <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with the solid execution of our organization, we believe sales were <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negatively</span> impacted by periods of very unseasonable weather early in the quarter. In Australia, sales continue to be very strong. Adjusted segment profit margin at TJX International excluding foreign currency was up 40 basis points, primarily due to operating leverage in Australia. Further, merchandise margin was up. In Europe, we remain <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">confident</span> that we&#x27;re <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gaining</span> market share, <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">despite</span> the <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">challenging</span> retail environment. Our European organization is capitalizing on the numerous <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">opportunities</span> in the vendor marketplace that the environment is presenting to us, as we add more exciding brands and vendors to our sourcing universe.I&#x27;ll finish with our shareholder distributions. During the first quarter, we bought back 400 million of TJX stock, retiring 4.9 million shares. We continue to anticipate buying back 2.5 to 3.0 billion of TJX stock this year. In addition, we increased the per-share dividend by 25% in April, marking the 22nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Now, let me turn the call back to Ernie and I will recap our second quarter and full-year Fiscal &#x27;19 guidance at the end of the call. Thanks, Scott. I&#x27;d like to reiterate the major reasons for our confidence and continuing to <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gain</span> market share around the world. First and foremost, we are convinced that our <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excellent</span> values, fashions, and brands will continue to drive consumers to our stores. In today&#x27;s evolving retail environment, with the growth of e-commerce in general, we are delivering <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excellent</span> value on comparable merchandise versus both brick-and-mortar and online retailers. In fact, we believe the growth of online retail has heightened the visibility of our values for consumers, which is very <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">positive</span> for our business.Second, we are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">confident</span> in the enduring appeal of the treasure-hunt shopping experience we offer. We are convinced that the ability to touch and feel the merchandise and the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">inspiration</span> that our shopping experience elicits leads to instant gratification, all important factors for shoppers.Further, we offer a wide variety of branded items across multiple categories in a simple, easy-to-shop layout. We also locate our stores in convenient, easy-to-access locations. Our flexible store format and rapidly changing assortments allow us to quickly react to changing consumer trends. This helps us ensure that our stores are fresh and there is always something to surprise and excite our customers.Third, while we continue to attract customers of all target age groups in all divisions, we are especially <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> that we have been <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">disproportionately</span> attracting new millennial and Gen-Z customers. This bodes very well for the future of TJX.Next, we are laser focused on driving customer traffic and comp sales. We have many initiatives planned to attract new consumers, encourage more frequent visits, and drive cross-banner shopping. We are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excited</span> about our marketing plans, which are moving toward a more continuous media strategy to support our business throughout the year. This includes more weeks on television this year, as well as a continued focus on digital platforms to ensure our retail banners show up wherever the consumer is looking.Further, we are emphasizing our loyalty programs across the US, Canada, and the UK, and are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">pleased</span> with the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> growth and the number of customers joining our programs. We&#x27;re focused on <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">enhancing</span> the shopping experience, <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">improving</span> customer satisfaction, and, as always, innovating. We feel <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">good</span> about the continued growth of our e-commerce sites. While still a small piece of our business, we&#x27;re <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">happy</span> to offer our customers the choice of when and where to shop us and our marketing is helping to make them aware that they can shop us 24/7.Next, we see a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">tremendous</span> <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">opportunity</span> to keep growing our global store base. Giving us confidence is our disciplined approach to real estate and decades of operational experience. Long term, we see the potential to grow our four major divisions to a total of 6,100 stores, with just our current chains and our current countries alone. The last reason for our confidence is product availability. We are extremely <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">confident</span> that we will always have access to <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> quality, branded merchandise to support our growth plans. Availability of inventory continues to be terrific and we are thrilled with what we are seeing in the global marketplace from both existing and new vendors.Let me share with you some of what we do at TJX to make it <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">attractive</span> for vendors to do business with us. First, we aim to establish long-term, mutually <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">beneficial</span> relationships. Our buyers around the world constantly work with vendors to find additional ways to do business.Next, we have over 4,000 stores across 9 countries, in addition to our online sites, and we are still growing. In an environment where other retails are <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">closing</span> stores, we can offer vendors an <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excellent</span> way to grow their business and access new markets. Further, we are very flexible in our dealings and offer vendors and <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">efficient</span> way to clear merchandise. We can purchase an extremely wide assortment of items, styles, and sizes, as well as quantities ranging from small to very large.Finally, we offer such <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> brands in our stores and see that vendors appreciate that their products will be mixed in with our other <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> brands. This is extremely <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">desirable</span> to them. Before I wrap up, I want to remind you that we are committed to reinvesting in our global business. While we&#x27;re expecting investment spending to be significant over the next few years, we believe we are making the right strategic investments to support our long-term growth plans. Further, in an environment where cost pressures continue to rise, we are using our off-price approach to look at long-term structural ways to reduce expenses.In closing, we feel <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">great</span> about our <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> start to the year and our plans for the second quarter and back half of 2018. We are extremely focused on our near-term execution, while simultaneously having our sights set on our long-term vision for TJX. The many <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strengths</span> for our business give us enormous confidence. We believe that the depth and breadth of our off-price knowledge in the US and in internationally is <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">unmatched</span> and extremely <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">difficult</span> to replicate. We are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">confident</span> that our relentless drive to bring consumers an exciting, treasure-hunt shopping experience, both in stores and online, and an ever-changing mix of <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excellent</span> brands at outstanding values will continue to be a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">winning</span> strategy for us. Again, our management team is passionate about <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">surpassing</span> our goals.Now, I&#x27;ll turn the call over to Scott to go through our guidance, and then we&#x27;ll open it up for questions. Scott? Thanks, Ernie. I&#x27;ll begin with our full-year Fiscal &#x27;19 guidance. For modeling purposes, I&#x27;ll remind you that Fiscal &#x27;19 is a 52-week year, compared to Fiscal &#x27;18, which was a 53-week year.As we mentioned in our press release this morning, we are increasing the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02. Our full-year plan assumes that $0.07 over $0.09 first quarter EPSB will be offset by the following factors.First, we are expecting a $0.03 <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negative</span> impact due to a combination of factors. This is primarily due to significantly higher freight costs than we originally anticipated, partially offset by the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">strong</span> operational performance we now expect as we&#x27;ve seen our non-comp store results exceeding our plans. Second, we expect about $0.02 of the first quarter <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> from our inventory hedge <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">gains</span> to reverse throughout the remainder of the year. Lastly, we now expect the full-year <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> from translational foreign exchange to come in $0.02 lower than we originally planned.I want to point out that we would&#x27;ve increased the high end of our EPS guidance further if not for the reduction of the expected translational FX benefit. On a GAAP basis, we expect Fiscal &#x27;19 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.83. We now expect a <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> of $0.72 to $0.73 from items related to the 2017 Tax Act. This <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> is approximately $0.02 lower than our previous guidance, as we continue to evaluate the impact from the 2017 Tax Act. Again, excluding this tax benefit, we&#x27;re increasing our adjusted earnings-per-share guidance from $4.04 to $4.10. This would be a 5% to 6% increase versus the adjusted $3.85 in Fiscal &#x27;18.Our guidance includes an assumption that wage increases will have a <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negative</span> impact to EPS growth of about 2%. This EPS guidance assumes consolidated sales in the $37.7 to $37.9 billion range, a 5% to 6% increase over the 53-week prior year. We&#x27;re assuming a 1% to 2% comp increase on a consolidated basis, similar to our plans for prior years. We expect pre-tax profit margin to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.8%, down 40 to 50 basis points versus the adjusted 11.2% in Fiscal &#x27;18. We&#x27;re planning gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 28.6% compared with the adjusted 28.8% last year.We&#x27;re expecting SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales in the range of 17.7% to 17.8% versus the adjusted 17.5% last year. For modeling purposes, we&#x27;re currently anticipating a tax rate of 26.2%, net it expense of $23 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 624 million. Now, to our full-year guidance by division.At Marmaxx, we&#x27;re continuing to plan comp growth of 1% to 2%. We&#x27;re now planning sales of $22.9 billion, and segment profit margin in the range of 13.2% to 13.3%. At HomeGoods, we continue to expect comps to increase 2% to 3% on sales of $5.7 billion. We&#x27;re planning segment profit margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 11.8%.For Canada, we continue to plan a comp increase of 2% to 3% on sales of $3.9 billion. The reduced total sales expectation is entirely due to translational FX. We&#x27;re now assuming a lower Canadian dollar rate for the remainder of the year, which may cause transactional FX to <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negatively</span> impact segment margin. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency is expected to be in the range of 14.6% to 14.8%.At TJX International, we continue to expect comp growth of 1% to 2% on sales of $5.3 to $5.4 billion. Adjusted segment profit margin excluding foreign currency is expected to be in the range of 5.1% to 5.3%.Moving on to Q2 guidance. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04, excluding an estimated <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> of $0.15 from items related to tax reform, adjusted earnings per share would be in the range of $0.87 to $0.89 to prior year&#x27;s $0.85 per share. This guidance assumes that <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">restructuring</span> costs within our global IT department will <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negatively</span> impact EPS growth by 3% to 4% and wage increases will <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negatively</span> impact EPS growth by another 2%. We are also anticipating that foreign currency will <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> EPS growth by 4%.As we noted in the press release this morning, these IT <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">restructuring</span> costs were recontemplated in our original plan. So, to be clear, these <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">restructuring</span> costs have no incremental <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">negative</span> impact to our expected Fiscal 2019 EPS growth versus our original guidance.We&#x27;re modeling second quarter consolidated sales of approximately $9 billion. This guidance assumes a 1% <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">benefit</span> to reported revenue due to translational FX. For comp store sales, we&#x27;re assuming growth in the 1% to 2% range on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Second quarter pre-tax profit margin is planned in the 9.7% to 9.9% range versus 10.7% of the prior year. We&#x27;re anticipating second quarter gross profit margin to be in the range of 28.2% to 28.4% versus 28.5% last year.We&#x27;re expecting SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be approximately 18.5% versus 17.8% last year. The expected increase in SG&amp;A is primarily due to the <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">restructuring</span> costs which, again, were contemplated in our original plan. For modeling purposes, we&#x27;re currently anticipating a tax rate of 26.6%, net interest expense of about $5 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately $629 million. It&#x27;s important to remember that our guidance for the second quarter and full-year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the second quarter. Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much. Good morning and congratulations on a really <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">excellent</span> first quarter. Scott, I wanted to ask about your commentary with regard to your global IT. I think you said reorganization or restructuring. I know you&#x27;ve been in process for a number of years now on <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">improving</span> the whole technology infrastructure. Can you just talk to us about the <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">progress</span> on that, the expected benefits and the need to do this reorganization, just what&#x27;s driving that? Thanks. Kimberly, it&#x27;s Ernie. I&#x27;ll jump in here for Scott. Really, this boiled down to -- and, by the way, this is certainly always a <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">difficult</span> thing to do for a number of reasons -- but it boiled down to positioning us for the future in terms of the IT area and for our growth plans. We really don&#x27;t give out the specifics of what the benefits are going to be. But it is something, as Scott had said, that we had in our plans contemplated already and felt it was necessary to take us into the next few years of the growth rates that we plan on achieving. Ernie, could I just ask a follow-up on your commentary during the prepared remarks with regard to inventory availability? It seems very clear to us, having followed the company here for almost 20 years that is never really an issue for you. But we&#x27;re still hearing sort of resurgent <span style=\"background-color:red;color:white\">concerns</span> out there. Given the inventory position, it looks like you are <span style=\"background-color:blue;color:white\">able</span> to find every bit as much inventory as you&#x27;d like to buy, but I thought I&#x27;d just give you a forum to opine on the availability of the inventory and the quality of goods you&#x27;re seeing."
